The DHCP client network configuration script is invoked from time to time by
<i><b><b><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/dhclient">dhclient</a></b>(8)</b></i>.
 This script is used by the dhcp client to set each interface's initial 
configuration prior to requesting an address, to test the
address once it has been offered, and to set the interface's final 
configuration once a lease has been acquired. If no lease is acquired, 
the script is used to
test predefined leases, if any, and also called once if no valid lease 
can be identified.
<p>This script is not meant to be customized by the end user. If local 
customizations are needed, they should be possible using the enter and 
exit hooks
provided (see HOOKS for details). These hooks will allow the user to 
override the default behaviour of the client in creating a <b>/etc/resolv.conf</b> file,
and to handle DHCP options not handled by default.
</p><p>No standard client script exists for some operating systems, even
 though the actual client may work, so a pioneering user may well need 
to create a new
script or modify an existing one. In general, customizations specific to
 a particular computer should be done in the <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> file. If
you find that you can't make such a customization without customizing <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> or using the enter and exit hooks, please submit a bug
report.
</p><h2>Hooks</h2>
When it starts, the client script first defines a shell function, <b>make_resolv_conf ,</b> which is
later used to create the <b>/etc/resolv.conf</b> file. To override the default behaviour, redefine this function in the enter hook script.
<p>On after defining the make_resolv_conf function, the client script checks for the presence of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks</b>
 script,
and if present, it invokes the script inline, using the Bourne shell '.'
 command. The entire environment documented under OPERATION is available
 to this
script, which may modify the environment if needed to change the 
behaviour of the script. If an error occurs during the execution of the 
script, it can set the
exit_status variable to a nonzero value, and <b>/sbin/dhclient-script</b> will exit with that error code immediately after the client script exits.
</p><p>After all processing has completed, <b>/sbin/dhclient-script</b> checks for the presence of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks</b>
 script, which
if present is invoked using the '.' command. The exit status of 
dhclient-script will be passed to dhclient-exit-hooks in the exit_status
 shell variable, and
will always be zero if the script succeeded at the task for which it was
 invoked. The rest of the environment as described previously for 
dhclient-enter-hooks
is also present. The <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks</b> script can modify the valid of exit_status to change the exit status of dhclient-script.
</p><p>Immediately after dhclient brings an interface UP with a new IP 
address, subnet mask, and routes, in the REBOOT/BOUND states, it will 
check for the
existence of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-up-hooks</b> script, and source it if found. This script can handle DHCP options in the environment that are
not handled by default. A per-interface. <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-up-hooks</b> script will override the generic script and be sourced when interface $IF has
been brought up.
</p><p>Immediately before dhclient brings an interface DOWN, removing 
its IP address, subnet mask, and routes, in the STOP/RELEASE states, it 
will check for the
existence of an executable <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-down-hooks</b> script, and source it if found. This script can handle DHCP options in the environment that are
not handled by default. A per-interface <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-down-hooks</b> script will override the generic script and be sourced when interface $IF is
about to be brought down.
</p><h2>Operation</h2>
When dhclient needs to invoke the client configuration script, it defines a set of variables in
the environment, and then invokes <b>/sbin/dhclient-script.</b> In all 
cases, $reason is set to the name of the reason why the script has been 
invoked. The
following reasons are currently defined: MEDIUM, PREINIT, BOUND, RENEW, 
REBIND, REBOOT, EXPIRE, FAIL, STOP, RELEASE, NBI and TIMEOUT.
<h2>Medium</h2>
The DHCP client is requesting that an interface's media type be set. The interface name is passed in
$interface, and the media type is passed in $medium.
<h2>Preinit</h2>
The DHCP client is requesting that an interface be configured as 
required in order to send packets
prior to receiving an actual address. For clients which use the BSD 
socket library, this means configuring the interface with an IP address 
of 0.0.0.0 and a
broadcast address of 255.255.255.255. For other clients, it may be 
possible to simply configure the interface up without actually giving it
 an IP address at
all. The interface name is passed in $interface, and the media type in 
$medium.
<p>If an IP alias has been declared in dhclient.conf, its address will 
be passed in $alias_ip_address, and that ip alias should be deleted from
 the interface,
along with any routes to it.
</p><h2>Bound</h2>
The DHCP client has done an initial binding to a new address. The new ip
 address is passed in
$new_ip_address, and the interface name is passed in $interface. The 
media type is passed in $medium. Any options acquired from the server 
are passed using the
option name described in <b>dhcp-options</b>, except that dashes ('-') are replaced by underscores ('_') in order to make valid shell variables, and the
variable names start with new_. So for example, the new subnet mask would be passed in $new_subnet_mask.
<p>Before actually configuring the address, dhclient-script should 
somehow ARP for it and exit with a nonzero status if it receives a 
reply. In this case, the
client will send a DHCPDECLINE message to the server and acquire a 
different address. This may also be done in the RENEW, REBIND, or REBOOT
 states, but is not
required, and indeed may not be desirable.
</p><p>When a binding has been completed, a lot of network parameters 
are likely to need to be set up. A new /etc/resolv.conf needs to be 
created, using the values
of $new_domain_name and $new_domain_name_servers (which may list more 
than one server, separated by spaces). A default route should be set 
using $new_routers,
and static routes may need to be set up using $new_static_routes.
</p><p>If an IP alias has been declared, it must be set up here. The 
alias IP address will be written as $alias_ip_address, and other DHCP 
options that are set for
the alias (e.g., subnet mask) will be passed in variables named as 
described previously except starting with $alias_ instead of $new_. Care
 should be taken
that the alias IP address not be used if it is identical to the bound IP
 address ($new_ip_address), since the other alias parameters may be 
incorrect in this
case.
</p><h2>Renew</h2>
When a binding has been renewed, the script is called as in BOUND, 
except that in addition to all the
variables starting with $new_, there is another set of variables 
starting with $old_. Persistent settings that may have changed need to 
be deleted - for
example, if a local route to the bound address is being configured, the 
old local route should be deleted. If the default route has changed, the
 old default
route should be deleted. If the static routes have changed, the old ones
 should be deleted. Otherwise, processing can be done as with BOUND.
<h2>Rebind</h2>
The DHCP client has rebound to a new DHCP server. This can be handled as with RENEW, except that if
the IP address has changed, the ARP table should be cleared.
<h2>Reboot</h2>
The DHCP client has successfully reacquired its old address after a reboot. This can be processed as
with BOUND.
<h2>Expire</h2>
The DHCP client has failed to renew its lease or acquire a new one, and the lease has expired.
The IP address must be relinquished, and all related parameters should be deleted, as in RENEW and REBIND.
<h2>Fail</h2>
The DHCP client has been unable to contact any DHCP servers, and any 
leases that have been tested
have not proved to be valid. The parameters from the last lease tested 
should be deconfigured. This can be handled in the same way as EXPIRE.
<h2>Stop</h2>
The dhclient has been informed to shut down gracefully, the dhclient-script should unconfigure or
shutdown the interface as appropriate.
<h2>Release</h2>
The dhclient has been executed using the -r flag, indicating that the administrator wishes it to
release its <b>lease</b>(s). dhclient-script should unconfigure or shutdown the interface.
<h2>Nbi</h2>
No-Broadcast-Interfaces...dhclient was unable to find any interfaces upon which it believed it
should commence DHCP. What dhclient-script should do in this situation is entirely up to the implementor.
<h2>Timeout</h2>
The DHCP client has been unable to contact any DHCP servers. However, an
 old lease has been
identified, and its parameters have been passed in as with BOUND. The 
client configuration script should test these parameters and, if it has 
reason to believe
they are valid, should exit with a value of zero. If not, it should exit
 with a nonzero value.
<p>The usual way to test a lease is to set up the network as with REBIND
 (since this may be called to test more than one lease) and then ping 
the first router
defined in $routers. If a response is received, the lease must be valid 
for the network to which the interface is currently connected. It would 
be more
complete to try to ping all of the routers listed in $new_routers, as 
well as those listed in $new_static_routes, but current scripts do not 
do this.
</p><h2>Files</h2>
Each operating system should generally have its own script file, 
although the script files for
similar operating systems may be similar or even identical. The script 
files included in Internet Systems Consortium DHCP distribution appear 
in the
distribution tree under client/scripts, and bear the names of the 
operating systems on which they are intended to work.
<h2>Bugs</h2>
If more than one interface is being used, there's no obvious way to 
avoid clashes between
server-supplied configuration parameters - for example, the stock 
dhclient-script rewrites /etc/resolv.conf. If more than one interface is
 being configured,
/etc/resolv.conf will be repeatedly initialized to the values provided 
by one server, and then the other. Assuming the information provided by 
both servers is
valid, this shouldn't cause any real problems, but it could be 
confusing.
